# RKE



RKE (Rancher Kubernetes Engine) is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution developed by Rancher Labs, 
a company specializing in container management and orchestration. RKE makes it easy to deploy and manage Kubernetes 
clusters on any infrastructure, including on-premises, cloud-based, or hybrid environments.


RKE clusters are Kubernetes clusters that are created, configured, and managed using RKE. 
RKE offers a simplified installation process that reduces the complexity of deploying Kubernetes clusters, especially for users who are not experienced with Kubernetes. 
RKE clusters can be customized with different components and configurations to meet specific requirements, and they can be scaled up or down as needed to accommodate changes in workload.
